# Iterative-Programming
Testing programs and debugging.
A program that prints Hello World to the screen 100 times.
A program that prints numbers on a new line and its square.
A program that asks for the numnbers of sides, lengths, color line and fill. It will compute and draw out a polygon with the color chosen.
A program that will print "Divisible by three" instead of the number and multiplies of five print.
The codes show a program that will draw out a star.
All these programs are helpful to help get to what it is asking.
